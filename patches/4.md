Spritearc wants to enable game developers to get good Pixelart assets to create unique and great games! That also opens up a new path for people who would like to share their pixelart. We want to create a universal platform that enables game developers to create the best possible indie games but also to let pixelart artist share their art. There will definitly be more features coming in the future as we just started.

### Perks when you use Spritearc:
- Best user experience out there.
- Clear indicitations if you can or can not use assets or sprites.
- Your recent released pack will definitly be seen on the front page since we have a section called "Recent Packs".
- Chances to be the title/promoted pack for a whole month.
