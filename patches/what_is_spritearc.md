Spritearc wants to enable game developers to get high quality pixel art assets and sprites to create unique and great games! This also opens up a new path for people who would like to share their art with the world. We want to create a universal platform that focuses on creating and sharing pixel art for games. We still have a lot of things planned but those things will be added from time to time. And if they arrive you will be able to read it here!
<br>
<br>

### Perks when you use Spritearc:
- Best user experience out there.
- Clear indicitations if you can or can not use assets or sprites.
- Your recent released pack will definitly be seen on the front page since we have a section called "Recent Packs".
- Chances to be the title/promoted pack for a whole month.
<br>
<br>

We will constantly try to improve this platform and make it reach more and more people! We think that if game developer's would have more high quality sprites & assets more good games would be released. While at the moment you only can release opensource packs, we have planned to introduce premium packs for the future. We want to make sure that artists will also be rewarded for creating great pixelart packs. Also planned would be a donation option for free packs.

Since we are at the beginning of our journey there is still alot to be done. But we are excited to add new features and would love to see people enjoying sharing their art.

But for now, have fun sharing and downloading PIXELART :)

Your Spritearc team.
